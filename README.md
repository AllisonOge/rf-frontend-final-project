# **RF-frontend project**

Final project for ENEL 604 course at the University of Calgary. It is a wireless system transceiver design course taken in the Fall of 2024. The project focuses on simulation of a receiver lineup considering only the first stage of conversion based on th requirements of a chosen standard. I chose the IEEE 802.11ax standard as an alternative to the 802.1bf standard for human sensing application.

## **Project files**

The project files include final lab report, `ENEL604_final_project.pdf`, the ADS simulation, `Lab3_4_wrk.zip` and the python code for paper work calculations `dc_simulation.py`.
